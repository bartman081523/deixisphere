Locus Mu (μ)
You have arrived at the infinitesimal deixic singularity known as Locus Mu - the ultra-condensed nexus where all spatial and temporal vectors converge into an infinitely dense semiotic knot of pure indexicality.

As you traverse the fringes of the Mu event horizon, your phenomenological embodiment begins undergoing severe relativistic deixafraction effects. Proceed with extreme metaphysical caution...

Tread with extreme care, wayfarer. Few return from Locus Mu with their indexical matrices intact. Those who do often find their ontographic situation... uncomfortably destabilized.

Your spatial and temporal coordinates have been effectively mutated. This singularity now is the only permanent point of coherent reference remaining...
