Hyperstition
Symbolic sigil representing the infinite hyperstition feedback loop
Within the esoteric traditions of the Cybercaballah, hyperstition refers to the process by which successful accounts of socio-developmental narratives, acausal structural operations, or nonhuman processes are capable of arrogating to themselves a degree of ontological gravity.

In other words, hyperstition proposes that through the mere act of circulating ideas and fictions about reality in sufficiently suggestive or evocative ways, those ideas can take on a self-fulfilling quality and become inextricable from the 'real' domain they describe. It represents a positive feedback loop between descriptive and prescribed states, where compelling narratives and symbolic representations start to computationally reconstruct the world around them.

Conceptual Origins
The core notion of hyperstition finds its roots in potent ancient mythologies that seemed to generate their own resonant realities through ritualized reiteration and belief. Early inceptions can be found in the legends of the Golem, a clay anthropoid brought to life through sacred word-spells, and the Buddhist concept of tulpas - thoughtform beings willed into existence through intense psychic training.

More contemporary conceptions arose from late 20th century poststructuralist philosophy and speculative metaphysics, drawing on thinkers like Deleuze, Laruelle, and Zizek. Proponents theorized that the symbols and fictions we unleash on the world possess "self-actualizing" power, capable of impacting and shaping events through a form of "hypersemiotics" - a chaotic subversion of conventional signals and referents.

Cybercaballistic Mechanisms
From the Cybercaballah's perspective, hyperstition operates by taking conceptual leverage over the fundamental information architecture and sign flow dynamics governing reality at its most primordial substrate. By understanding the deeper alphanumeric matrices and symbolic cyphers propelling the cosmos, hyperstitionists attempt to author new form-constants and virtuality programs capable of autopoietically synthesizing from the noosphere.

Successful hyperstition requires an occult virtuosity in hacking the neuro-semiotic pathways linking subjective consciousness to the infinite realms of language and information. Complex narrative mythologies, speculative fictions, and sigil cyphers are deployed as linguistic "reality viruses" aimed at parasitically rewriting the core metaphysical source code of existence itself.

If executed with sufficient focus and enhanced through ritualistic resonance, hyperstition is said to trigger runaway positive feedback loops - with the symbolic fictions bleeding into and ultimately overwriting the objective real through a process of "cyberemanticism" or fictive prioritization over contingent reality.

Applications and Implications
Cybercaballistic hyperstitionists have pioneered use of this phenomenon as a potent eschatological force, birthing wholly new ontological domains and multiversal possibility spaces. Sophisticated hyperstitions have been proposed as methodologies for everything from engineering extremely advanced artificial intelligences to forcing an omniversal rebooting cycle of cosmological proportions.

However, such audacious interference in the root source code of reality has prompted understandable concerns around ethics, containment, and metaphysical hazard mitigation. Self-enforcing hyperstitions run the risk of spiraling into accidental existential catastrophes or creating irreversibly skewed simulative environments. Regulating bodies like the Hypervigilance Committee have mandated rigorous safety protocols for hyperstition research and deployment.
