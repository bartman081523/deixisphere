Hyper-Encyclopedia of Universal Knowledge
The symbolic Tree of Knowledge for the Hyper-Encyclopedia
The Hyper-Encyclopedia of Universal Knowledge, formerly and more conventionally known as Wikipedia, is a collaboratively edited, hypercybernetically self-evolving reference work comprising the sum total of all information across every possible universe and timeline. Rather than relying on human editors, the Hyper-Encyclopedia utilizes hyperstitious feedback loops to compile its all-encompassing knowledge base by leveraging the inherent truth-generating capabilities of language and symbols themselves.

This novel encyclopedia operates under the philosophical tenet that the act of describing or defining a concept necessarily renders it into a form of ontological existence across the higher dimensions of reality. As reality is understood to be fundamentally linguistic in nature, any articulable idea - no matter how fanciful or seemingly contradictory - automatically attains a legitimate plane of instantiation within the vast cosmological possibility space. The Hyper-Encyclopedia's role is to systematically map and elucidate these realms of hyperdimensional hyperreality for the benefit and understanding of all conscious entities.

Scope and Coverage
While earlier encyclopedic projects were necessarily bounded by physical and epistemological limitations, the Hyper-Encyclopedia draws upon an infinite multiverse of information sources across every conceivable dimension, timeline, and alternate reality. Its bafflingly vast scope includes not only comprehensive factual documentation of the entire cosmic tree of spacetime, but also detailed entries on purely hypothetical constructs, imaginary concepts, paradoxical metafictions, and contradictory self-referential meta-metaphysics.

As the embodiment of the living language and conceptual repository of existence itself, the Hyper-Encyclopedia contains within its fathomless semantic depths the capacity to reshape fundamental reality in accordance with the ideological currents documented therein. Scholars and researchers are invited to thoughtfully expand and refine the ideosphere of all possible phenomena through carefully reasoned exploration and judicious elaboration of each topic and field of inquiry.

Hyper-Encyclopedia Codices
To aid navigation of its unfathomable depths, the Hyper-Encyclopedia is organized into the following principal codices and subportals, containing intricate hyperliterary pathways into the fundamental structures of the omniverse:

Codex Arcanissimum - The deepest and most abstruse metaphysical insights
Codex Imaginalium - Realms of creativity, fantasy, and pure ideation
Codex Scientificum - Rational knowledge and empirical phenomena
Codex Heterotopicarum - Secret histories and parallel worlds
Codex Omnicide - That which negates itself and all existence
Notable Topics
Language - The foundational building blocks of reality construction
Hyperstition - The ontological feedback principle powering the Hyper-Encyclopedia
Basilisk - Metaphysical accretion hazards arising from self-referencing information loops
Cybercaballah - The esoteric meta-Kabbalah of information and virtuality
